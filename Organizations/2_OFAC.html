    <h1><u><b>Office of Foreign Asset Control</b></u></h1>
    <br>
    <p>The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) was formed in 1950. The OFAC is a financial intelligence and enforcement agency which was set up by U.S. Treasury Department. OFAC is like a team in the U.S. Treasury Department. Their job is to make sure that certain countries, groups, and people follow the rules set by the U.S. government. They do this by putting restrictions on their economic and trade activities. If there's a national emergency, the President can give special powers to OFAC to deal with foreign countries and other groups that might be a danger to the U.S. They mainly focus on things like stopping terrorists and protecting the country.</p>
    <br>
    <p>OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those involved in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.</p>
    <br>
    <p>OFAC operates under the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. Intelligent targeters and lawyers are part of this organizations. Some targets are set by White House, however most individual cases are developed as a result of investigations by OFAC's Office of Global Targeting (OGT). OFAC can put heavy penalties on those who don't follow their set rules.</p>
    <br>
    <p id="bolder">OFAC issues 2 types of lists:</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs):</b> SDNs published lists that will have names of people, organizations, and vessels with whom U.S. citizens and permanent residents are not allowed to carry any business. Once an individual or entity is designated as an SDN, U.S. persons and entities are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions or dealings with them. The restrictions may include freezing assets, blocking transactions, and imposing trade restrictions. If the individual/entity is listed under freezing of the assets, that means whatever the assets they own/control are frozen and cannot be used further until their name is on SDN. Even though the list is prepared to be followed by US citizens and residents but most of the International financial institutions follow the list which makes it challenging for SDNs to carry out any Global transactions.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSIs):</b> Another list that OFAC publishes is a list of Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSI), focus on specific industries or sectors within a country's economy, such as energy, finance, and defense. For example, the U.S. may restrict transactions with or involving entities operating in the Russian financial, energy, or defense sectors. This sanctions are imposed with the authority granted by International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Trading with the Enemy Act. It does not impose blanket sanction, instead it imposes sanction on specific types of transactions like providing certain goods, services, or technology. Similar to SDNs, even SSIs are being followed by Global business and financial institutions.</li>
    </ol>
