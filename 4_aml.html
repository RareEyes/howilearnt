    <h1><u><b>Anti-Money Laundering</b></u></h1>
    <br>
    <h3><u>Introduction:</u></h3>
    <p>Anti-money laundering (AML) refers to the set of laws, regulations, and procedures aimed at preventing criminals from concealing illegally obtained funds or assets. AML measures help to identify, track, and report suspicious financial activities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>AML refers to a set of regulations, laws, and procedures designed to prevent individuals and entities from disguising the origins of illegally obtained funds through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b><i>What is money laundering?</i></b></p>
    <p>To get what AML is about, let's talk about Money Laundering (ML) first. Imagine you get money in a not-so-legal way, and you can't disclose it to the government where it really came from. If you can't prove where your money is from, you can't spend it openly (atleast you can't buy expensive items/assets). So, you need to be sneaky and figure out ways to hide where the money actually came from and make it seem like it's totally okay to use.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Money laundering is the process of disguising the proceeds of crime by integrating it into the legitimate financial system. Money laundering is when criminals try to hide money they got from doing bad things, like selling drugs or stealing, by putting it into normal bank accounts or making it look like it came from legal activities. They do this by doing many different transactions to confuse where the money really came from. This way, they can use the money without getting caught for their crimes.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The term "money laundering" is derived from the fact that criminals attempt to "clean" their dirty money through a series of complex transactions, making it appear as though the funds were obtained from a legitimate source.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b><i>Are there any stages of money laundering?</i></b></p>
    <p>Yes, all the activities of money laundering generally categorise into following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Placement:</b> In simple terms, we can call it as introduction of dirty money to the finanacial system. This could involve activities like depositing cash into bank accounts, purchasing assets, or investing in businesses.</li>
        <li><b>Layering:</b> We can call it as Complex wiring system where it is moved through a series of transactions to obscure its origin and make it harder to trace. This may involve transferring funds between accounts, making multiple purchases and sales of assets, or moving money through shell companies and offshore accounts.</li>
        <li><b>Integration:</b> We can refer this as "out of the dry cleaning" where the laundered funds are reintroduced into the economy as seemingly legitimate wealth. This could involve investing the money in legitimate businesses, purchasing real estate, or making high-value purchases.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Now that we've got a bit of an idea about Money Laundering (ML), let's talk about AML. When it comes to illegal stuff, the government doesn't just sit back and let it happen. They've put together rules and steps for financial and non-financial institutions to follow. These rules are called AML policies. It's like a guide to make sure money doesn't get sneaky and illegal.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b><i>What are the components of AML Compliance?</i></b></p>
    <p><b>Know Your Customer:</b> Obtaining and verifying customer identity like documentary evidence of existence of individuals/entities, their nature of business, place of business, ownership details etc.</p><br>
    <p><b>Enhanced Due Diligence: </b> Conduct detailed review of the customers with higher risk, such as the countries they deal in, their nature of business, parties associated with the customer, day to day transaction etc. </p><br>
    <p><b>Transaction Monitoring: </b>Monitoring transaction irrespective of which category of risk the customer falls in. This is to make sure that customer activity is in line with their declaration on the bank form.</p><br>
    <p><b>Record Keeping: </b>Every financial/non-financial institutions are supposed to keep the record of their customers (documentary evidence of the existence etc.) to a certain period as per the law of the country/bank.</p><br>
    <p><b>Reporting:</b> Every financial institution is required to promptly report any suspicious activity or other pertinent information to the Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) in the respective countries where they operate.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Overall, AML measures are critical for maintaining the integrity and stability of the financial system and protecting businesses and society from the harmful effects of financial crime</p>
