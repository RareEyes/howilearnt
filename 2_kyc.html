<h1><b><u>Know Your Customer</u></b></h1>
<br>
<h3>Definition:</h3>

    <p>KYC, or Know Your Customer, or Know Your Client, is a process used by businesses and financial institutions to verify the identity of their customers. It is an effective method that a financial institution can use to confirm its customer's authenticity. It's primary purpose is to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Put simply, it's about how much you understand your customer by looking at how risky they might be (Low, Medium, High). Every Financial and Non-Financial institutions put in place certain requirement to understand their customer based on what risk category they belongs to. None of these institutions look all risk types with single lens</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Process of Onboarding Customer:</h4>
    <br>
    <img src="Images/KYC Process.png" width="700px">
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>What is this RISK now?</h4>
    <p>Risk in KYC refers to the level of money laundering risk that a customer may pose to a financial institution. It also means the potential danger or uncertainty associated with a customer engaging in financial transactions.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Are there any categories of risk?</h4>
    <p>Yes, generally, financial institutions categorise risk into 3 categories.</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>High Risk:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>These customers are those with characteristics that suggest a higher likelihood of involvement in financial crimes, such as money laundering or fraud.</li>
            <li>High-risk customers can include individuals or entities with unusual or large transactions, complex ownership structures, unclear sources of funds, high networth individuals (HNI), or connections to politically exposed persons (PEPs). These customers often require enhanced due diligence to thoroughly understand and mitigate associated risks.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><b>Medium Risk:</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>These are those customers that might have involvement in financial crimes but not on a higher side.</li>
            <li>Medium-risk customers might have occasional unusual transactions or engage in activities that slightly deviate from the norm. Their financial history may have some complexities, but not to the extent seen in high-risk cases.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><b>Low Risk:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>These customers deemed less likely to be involved in illegal or unethical activities.</li>
            <li>These customers generally have straightforward and transparent financial profiles, with regular and predictable transactions. They may have a stable financial history and clear sources of income.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h4>How Financial Institution determines risk category?</h4>
    <p>Every financial insititutions have their own approach of arriving at assigning risk rating to the customer. However, we will outline few of the very common approach the organizations follow:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Customer Profile</li>
        <li>Nature of Business</li>
        <li>Type of Relationship with the Financial Institution</li>
        <li>Geographical location(s)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Customer Due Diligence:</h4>
    <p>Customer Due Diligence (CDD), is a process that financial institutions and certain other businesses undertake to verify and understand the identity of their customers and assess the risks associated with them.</p>
    <p>CDD is often mandated by regulatory authorities, the purpose of this is to establish customer's identity, understand the nature of their activities, and assess the risk they pose in terms of money laundering, terrorist financing, or other financial crimes.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Enhanced Due Diligence:</h4>
    <p>Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD), is a higher level investigation of CDD. It is a more comprehensive and intensive form of due diligence. This is typically applied where the risk level of the entity is high.</p>
    <p>The purpose of EDD is to conduct more thorough investigation to understand the customer to mitigate the heightened risks associated with the customer.</p>
    <p>The scope of EDD is to gether detailed information about the customer and counterparty associated with the customer, additional background checks on customer and related parties, verifying the legitimacy of documents and information provided by the customer and monitoring the transactions.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Ongoing Due Diligence:</h4>
    <p>This is very important concept in KYC. Once the customer is onboarded and assigned a particular risk rating then its the responsibility of the financial institution to monitor the customer behaviour.</p>
    <p>For this purspose, almost all the financial institutions have ongoing due diligence for their customers based on their risk rating. Generally, for high risk customer, they will be reviewed yearly. Medium risk once in 3 years and low risk customers once in 5 years. But this timeframe differs based on jurisdiction as well as the policy of the FI.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Why the banks should perform ongoing due diligence? Why can't they just onboard a customer, assign risk rating and forget about it?</h4>
    <p>The major reason for performing ongoing due diligence is to check whether customer's transaction pattern and all other factors are still the same or have they changed as this would again change their risk rating.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For example, previously a low risk customer was dealing in only one country, however now they are dealing with multiple countries and there are countries which the FI's have tagged it as high risk. So, this will trigger a change in the customer risk rating which will have direct impact on FI's risk apetite of the customer.</p>
