    <h1><b><u>Legal Entity Types:</u></b></h1>
    <br>
    <p>There are various types under which an entity can be formed, depending on the requirements of individuals or groups. In this discussion, we will provide a brief overview of these entities here, with detailed information provided in individual sections.</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Private Limited Companies/Limited Liability Company</b>
            <ul>
                <li>A private limited company is a company established by a few individuals privately. The shareholders of a private limited company cannot trade their shares publicly. A private limited company cannot issue a prospectus inviting the public to subscribe to its shares.</li>
                <li>In legal terms, Section 2 (68) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines a private company as: 

                    “A Company having a minimum paid-up share capital as may be prescribed, and which by its articles,— (i) restricts the right to transfer its shares; (ii) except in case of One Person Company, limits the number of its members to two hundred; (iii) prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for any securities of the company.”</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Public Listed Companies</b> 
            <ul>
                <li>A public listed company, also known as a publicly traded company or a publicly held company, is a company whose ownership is structured in a way that allows its shares to be freely traded on a stock exchange or over-the-counter (OTC) market. These shares are bought and sold by investors in the open market.</li>
                <li>A public company is a corporation whose shareholders have a claim to part of the company's assets and profits.</li>
                <li>Ownership of a public company is distributed among general public shareholders through the free trade of shares of stock on stock exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) markets.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Limited Liability Partnership</b> 
            <ul>
                <li>Limited liability partnership (LLP) is a type of general partnership where every partner has a limited personal liability for the debts of the partnership.</li>
                <li>LLPs allow limited liability even if partners remain involved in the management of the business.</li>
                <li>For example, Mr A and Mr B have opened a restaturant and due to some reason people fell sick because of this resturant food, then they cannot both be personally sued for damages as their liability will be limited.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>General Partnership</b> 
            <ul>
                <li>A general partnership is a business arrangement by which two or more individuals agree to share responsibilities, assets, profits, and financial and legal liabilities of a jointly-owned business.</li>

Each partner is personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business, and their personal assets may be used to satisfy business debts.</li>
